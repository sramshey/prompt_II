Berkeley Emeritus AI/ML project assignment

Vehicle sale price data exploration

## Description
This project was an analysis of vehicle data in order to determine the best predictors of prices and use
them to create predictive models. The analysis involved exploring the data, cleaning and transforming it
where necessary, modeling it using several different regression methods, comparing the models against eachother,
and evaluating them to gain insights into the data and further model improvements.

## Step 1 - Data Review and Cleaning
The data was reviewed to develop a business understanding of its content. Obvious relationships were explored.
Missing data was removed, and the price data was cleaned of outlyers. 

## Step 2 - Modeling
Several models were used on the data including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and
Random Forest Regression. The models were evaluated against each other by comparing variance
L2 loss, and other methods.

## Step 3 - Evaluation
The highest contributing data features in the provided set were determined, and several models
were compared against each other. At least 1 improvement to the model was attempted, and others
were suggested based on the findings.

## Step 4 - Deployment
Findings were summarized for business presentation.
